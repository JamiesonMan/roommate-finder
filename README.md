Objective:
  Design a roommate finder application which allows a user to sumbit their preferences related to their living enviornment, this can be saved as an object
  in class Roommate. Then in order to evaluate if two roommates share similar preferences, an algorithm returns a weighted value representing the similarities of
  the two Roommates. One of these are made between every roommate in the database. The user is then shown good possible roommates with those similar weighted values.
  
  This is the major part of the backend. Things to better the preformance if the database of roommates is high might be pruning algorithms, etc.
